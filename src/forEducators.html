                  SayMe – what is it?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-section__text">
                  SayMe offers a novel approach to anonymity. On an Instagram story, users share their SayMe link, allowing their followers to send them private messages to their SayMe mailbox. We think anonymity should offer a fun, secure environment where you may share your thoughts and ideas without fear of ridicule or condemnation. The current social media landscape leaves young people without a place to express their emotions without fear of judgment from peers or cultural expectations. For teens, SayMe offers this secure environment.

                  Why do my pupils use SayMe?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-section__text">
                  The authenticity of social media has drastically declined. Though the media first served as a platform for people to openly communicate their ideas, feelings, and lives, it has since evolved into a competition to see whose life can appear to be the most flawless. SayMe seeks to remove this appearance of untruthfulness and replace it with the freedom of anonymity, enabling our users to speak freely and openly without worrying about criticism. If your pupils are using SayMe, we can assure you that it is a new way for them to express themselves and is not simply another social media app taking up space on their phone.

                  1. To remove offensive language and bullying, we employ cutting-edge AI content moderation that makes use of deep learning and character pattern-matching algorithms based on rules.

As a result, we are up-to-date with culture, conversant in jargon, and skilled at spotting misleading information.<br/><br/>
