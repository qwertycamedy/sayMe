                  It’s a new vision of anonymity. You need to post a link with
                  your SayMe on IG story to receive messages from a secret
                  sender to your app mailbox. We think that anonymity should be
                  a friendly and protected space where you can safely show
                  yourself. Youths have not found a platform on which they can
                  talk about their emotions freely and without punishment yet.
                  That’s why SayMe created this independent community for
                  teenagers.

                  The SayMe creators are really concerned about the level of the
                  app safety. They are trying hard to keep your usage of the
                  SayMe platform as secure as possible! The SayMe team operates
                  on premium AI content moderation and works with data of a deep
                  learning, as well as comparing signs by rule to keep bad
                  comments off the net. This algorithm also studies emojis, and
                  then the web scraper examines specific situations in which
                  they appear. Be sure that the platform is always trendy and
                  manages the jargon perfectly to save you from unpleasant
                  comments.<br /><br />
                  The SayMe team follows strict rules to provide their clients
                  with a high level of safety. You are welcome to contact the

                  How to secure my kid from bulling on the platform?
                </h5>
                <p class="text-section__text">
                  We are always ready to help you and your kid in the case of
                  bulling threat. To start with, keep away from suspicious users
                  who act in a bad manner. Just remember that the most winning
                  option is silence. After that, go through these three steps to
                  get back after such experience:<br /><br />
                  <br /><br />
                  1. Block the sender - block unnecessary users just in two
                  clicks and stop bullying from the very beginning.<br /><br />
                  2. Click on «report» button in your dialogue - please let us
                  know about unhealthy messages and bad words, so we can make
                  our system more useful. By receiving alarms from «report»
                  button, the SayMe team identifies potential users who can bull
                  other people.<br /><br />
                  3. Take a quick break - to make your kid feel better, create a
                  caring atmosphere and remove the platform from his phone for
                  some time.<br /><br />
                  4. Ask for help - getting back after bulling is a hard and
                  time-consuming process, so that's OK to ask for someone's
                  help.
